The audacity of the recent actions by immigration officials — separating children from their parents en masse, and warehousing the kids indefinitely in underequipped facilities — explains some of the recent abandonment of political civility. President Trump’s very nature, regardless of actions, explains some more. But only some. Civility has been under open assault for […]","Civil society

An oft-overlooked asset of a political party is its potential to reduce the threat of minority factions or corruption of republican government by a small clique of insiders.
If we think about politics over the course of the past two generations, divided government definitely has had its advantages. Both sides have been able to enjoy a taste of power, and the public has had regular opportunities to dial back policy excesses.
Our union is all right. It may not be the happiest of moments in our nation’s history — though it is far from the least happy! — but the state of our union is strong.
For too long, federal authority has grown quietly, without explicit public sanction. And if we have come to a point where our institutions no longer can responsibly wield the power they have acquired, then everything should be on the table — nationalizing our institutions as well as reinforcing the constitutional limits to their power.","American politics

Poverty Studies 
Robert Doar is the president and Morgridge Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
Mr. Doar joined AEI in 2014 to create a new body of work on poverty studies, after serving for more than 20 years in leadership positions in the social service programs of New York State and New York City under Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. AEI’s poverty studies program and the scholars in it have since become leading voices in the national discussion on the importance of work, family, and personal responsibility in human flourishing.
While at AEI, Mr. Doar has served also as a co-chair of the National Commission on Hunger and as a lead member of the AEI-Brookings Working Group on Poverty and Opportunity. He was editor of “A Safety Net That Works: Improving Federal Programs for Low-Income Americans” (AEI Press, 2017) and a contributing author to “This Way Up: New Thinking About Poverty and Economic Mobility” (2018); “Work, Skills, Community: Restoring Opportunity for the Working Class” (2018); and “Opportunity, Responsibility, and Security: A Consensus Plan for Reducing Poverty and Restoring the American Dream” (2015).
In January 2019, Mr. Doar was selected by AEI’s Board of Trustees to be the Institute’s 12th president, succeeding Arthur Brooks on July 1, 2019. Mr. Doar leads one of the nation’s oldest and most respected public policy think tanks, which is dedicated to bolstering free enterprise and innovation, strengthening our communities, defending our nation’s founding values, and revitalizing the foundations of American defense.

Good evening everyone. I’m Robert Doar, president of AEI, and, on behalf of our chairman Dan D’Aniello and the entire AEI community, I welcome you to our Annual Dinner. We’re so glad you could join us this evening, when we have the privilege of celebrating two great Americans: Irving Kristol and Ambassador Nikki Haley. I […]
I spent seven years running New York City’s welfare programs for former mayor Michael Bloomberg, and as proud as I was of what our social service programs provided to poor New Yorkers, I never forgot that the key to helping struggling families was a vibrant economy that offered an abundance of entry-level jobs. That’s why […]
Work activity among prime-age (25 to 54) men in America has declined precipitously, leaving seven million or more working-age men in the US outside the labor force. 
Monday saw the release of “Freedom from Hunger: An Achievable Goal for the United States of America.” I was a co-chair of the bipartisan commission established by Congress to look at the issue of hunger in America, and our report is the result of 18 months of hard work. That we were able to produce a report with unanimous backing is an accomplishment in itself.
Economic trends, cultural changes, and changes in family and marriage patterns are combining in new ways that make it harder for those born on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder to lift themselves up. Poverty is changing, and policy responses must change too.
American Enterprise Institute Scholars Robert Doar, Ryan Streeter, and W. Bradford Wilcox discuss how to restore economic opportunities for the American working class through policy change.
New York City’s welfare system is managed out of a boxy 25-story office building on Water Street in Lower Manhattan. Approximately 5,000 employees work there, directing government programs that provide billions of dollars of taxpayer-funded assistance to the poor and near-poor. A solid majority of the workers at 180 Water Street are African-American or Latino; […]
These findings suggest that the poor, while no doubt struggling, are better off financially than those on the left often assert. The need for additional spending to increase household resources may not be as great as they claim. The findings also suggest that programs for low-income Americans are more effective in reducing poverty than those on the right often acknowledge.","Economic mobility

At the FDA, Dr. Gottlieb focused on a wide variety of issues, including drug pricing, medical product innovation, food safety, vaccination, and tobacco and vaping. He advanced new policies to address opioid addiction, working to rationalize prescribing as a way to reduce the rate of new addiction. He helped make the regulatory process for the development and review of novel drug and medical devices more efficient, including the approval of the first gene-therapy-based cancer treatment. He also presided over a record number of novel drug and medical device approvals in 2017 — and then broke that record in 2018.
Dr. Gottlieb helped promote competition through the approval of a record number of generic drugs, including the creation of new pathways for developing generic copies of complex drugs. He also helped advance the FDA’s Oncology Center for Excellence, which fosters a collaborative scientific environment to improve the development and regulation of oncology products. In addition, he helped implement the 21st Century Cures Act to accelerate medical product development.
Dr. Gottlieb previously served in other capacities at the FDA, including as deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs, senior adviser for medical technology, and director of medical policy development.

An economist by training, Senator Phil Gramm has had a long and distinguished career in public service, academia and the private sector. Before joining AEI, Sen. Gramm was the vice chairman of UBS Investment Bank, where he provided strategic economic, political and policy advice to important corporate and institutional clients. He served in the US Congress representing Texas for more than two decades, first as the 6th congressional district representative to the US House of Representatives, then later as senator. His legislative record includes landmark bills like the Gramm-Latta Budget – which reduced federal spending, rebuilt national defense and mandated the Reagan tax cut – and the Gramm-Rudman Act, which placed the first binding constraints on federal spending. As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Gramm steered legislation modernizing banking, insurance and securities laws. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act amended the 70-year-old Glass-Steagall Act,  allowing banks, security companies and insurance companies to affiliate through a financial services holding company.  Sen. Gramm taught economics at Texas A&M University for 12 years before becoming a member of Congress. He has published numerous articles and books on subjects ranging from private property, monetary theory and policy to the economics of mineral extraction.

For campaigns short of war, the role of political will becomes even more complex. “Short of war” challenges confound, confuse, and reduce a leader’s confidence in the validity of how he perceives a given situation.
Current operational models do not adequately reflect the challenges of “gray zone” warfare, leading to a misallocation of the instruments of national power to address nonconventional threats.
Long-term strategic success necessitates using armed forces beyond declared warfare, maintaining military presence in foreign regions, fostering sociocultural understandings, and aligning operations with other elements of national power.
Achieving the optimal balance between conventional forces and special operations forces will require recalibration through sound policy.

While annual poverty rates and monthly unemployment figures are useful, from a policy perspective, it matters whether individuals experience poverty and unemployment for short periods of time or persistently.
Too few of America’s poor work for pay, which not only robs them of this sense of purpose but also affects their families’ prospects for prosperity. The reasons poor, working-age people cite for not working primarily fall into two categories: nonworkers (overwhelmingly female) with children tend to cite family and home responsibilities, and those without children disproportionately cite disability and illness. Looking for but not finding work accounts for a small overall share.
Any American child in poverty is one too many, but increased spending cannot be the sole answer.","child care

The strategic competition between the US and China is principally the product of regime-driven differences over both what constitutes their national interests and what their respective visions were for the character of China’s rise.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established to meet the security threat posed by the Soviet Union. Often overlooked, though, are the ways in which it has provided the material and behavioral grounds for the larger liberal order in Europe to emerge.
Once the envy of the world, the US Navy can no longer deliver instantaneous and overwhelming force around the globe—once the sine qua non of American power projection.
This volume focuses on how Congress in the 21st century can once again fulfill its proper functions of representation, deliberation, legislation, and oversight. The authors offer a series of practical reforms that would maintain, rather than replace, the constitutional separation of powers that has served the nation well for more than 200 years.
Time and again, in recent years, the charge has been made that sitting presidents have behaved “imperially,” employing authorities that break the bounds of law and the Constitution. “The Imperial Presidency and the Constitution” examines this critical issue from a variety of perspectives.

Key Points Partial decoupling from China is overdue. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) suppresses foreign competition and infringes intellectual property. It is an ugly dictatorship at home and increasingly aggressive overseas. Decoupling involves a range of tools and economic activities. Policymakers should quickly move to document and respond to Chinese subsidies, implement already legislated […]
Key Points As expected given COVID-19, China’s construction and, especially, investment around the world plunged in the first half of 2020. The decline may be exaggerated by Chinese firms not wanting to report global activity, but Beijing’s happy numbers are not credible. From what little can be discerned, the Belt and Road Initiative is becoming […]
The China Global Investment Tracker (CGIT) is the only comprehensive public data set covering China’s global investment and construction, which are documented both separately and together.
Official Chinese economic data are often the only game in town, but they are untrustworthy.
When will China pass the US in economic size? “The year 2030” is not a bad estimate, but so is “never.”
Disputes between Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and the opposition obscure the crucial fact that India has pursued the same unwise economic policies regardless of who has been in office. The result is decent economic performance while the possibility of a true breakthrough slips away.
Is Scissors correct that the US-China relationship is about to permanently shrink? And if so, how will this change affect the global order? A symposium of economists responds.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership has severe weaknesses as a trade agreement. It offers both commercial and diplomatic benefits, but its value is undermined by extensive nonconforming measures, by rules of origin that risk blocking gains from both the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and future deals, and by grossly inadequate treatment of state-owned enterprises.
India’s growth in GDP would constitute a resounding success only if it was labor intensive, involving sustained and large-scale job creation. That will require easing very restrictive labor market regulations, first and foremost, as well as taking other steps such as permitting full private ownership of land, privatizing some banks, shifting trade policies and liberalizing the manufacturing labor market. 
Download the PDF Reactions to the Chinese Communist Party’s announcement of major economic reforms in November have ranged from unbridled optimism to skepticism about the party’s ability to implement sweeping change.
